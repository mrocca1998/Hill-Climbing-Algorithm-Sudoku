HillClimbing Algorithm testing:


input:
4
****

****

Reason: edge case where there are no default values in the board

Expected outcome: There are many possible solutions in this case. 
Running several times should produce different solutions.
One possible solution could be 
1   2   3   4
3   4   1   2
2   1   4   3
4   3   2   1


input:
1234
3412
2143
4321

Reason: Edge case where all values are filled in. The algorithm will recognize the initial state is a solution
and will return the initial state as the final solution

Expected outcome:
1   2   3   4
3   4   1   2
2   1   4   3
4   3   2   1


input:
1234
3412
21*3
4321

Reason: edge case where only one value is not permanent. Should be found in just one iteration.

Expected outcome 
1   2   3   4
3   4   1   2
2   1   4   3
4   3   2   1


input:
24**
*3**
**4*
**31

Reason: routine case #1

Expected outcome:
2   4   1   3
1   3   2   4
3   1   4   2
4   2   3   1


input:
**1*
4***
***2
*3**

Reason: routine case #2 with fewer default values

Expected outcome:

3   2   1   4
4   1   2   3
1   4   3   2
2   3   4   1


input:
2***
*1*2
**3*
***4

Reason: routine case #3

Expecetd outcome:
2   4   1   3
3   1   4   2
4   2   3   1
1   3   2   4
